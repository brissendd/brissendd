I've been studying in Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University (St. Petersburg, Russia) for 6 years.

My very first programming experience was Python at the beginning of my university years. Firstly, i thought that programming is not for me, and i dropped it. 

I've been coding on Python from time to time just because i needed to create or try something for a term project.

Then i found out about Dart & Flutter, and i loved it.

Now i'm trying to improve my Dart & Flutter knowledge every day.

Soon i will finish my pet-project, so i can find a job, where i could practice and learn something new even more.


<h4>Experience</h4>

Flutter, Dart, Git, Bloc, Hive, Dio, Retrofit

In my portfolio: completed technical assignment.

Have a good day!
